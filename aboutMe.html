								<h2>About Me, continued</h2>
								<p>Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Payton and I am a computer 
									science student with a passion for technology, programming, and creative 
									technology. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer 
									Science, with a concentration in Creative Technology, at the
									University of Regina.
									<br>
									<br>
									My interest in computers began at a young age, and since then I have been 
									fascinated by the limitless possibilities that technology offers. Throughout 
									my academic career, I have gained a solid foundation in C++, JavaScript, 
									and Python and I have also developed skills in Arduino 
									based hardware, game design, and basic animation.
									<br>
									<br>
									In addition to my academic pursuits, I have also worked on various projects 
									outside of the classroom, including teaching girls coding classes at the
									<a href="https://www.sasksciencecentre.com/go-code-programs#GoCodeGirls">Saskatchewan Science Centre</a>, being a featured mentor and activity leader
									for a <a href="https://skscgirlsinsteam.ca/animationandcoding/">
										Girls in STEAM</a> day conference, and participating in GlobalGameJam.
									<br>
									<br>
									Following graduation this spring, I will continue my career with 
									<a href="https://www.ilm.com/">Industrial Light and Magic</a> as an Associate Production Engineer, where I 
									have been using my technical skills to support the production process. 
									My responsibilities include designing, implementing, and maintaining custom 
									software tools for the production team, troubleshooting technical issues, 
									and collaborating with various departments to ensure a seamless production 
									workflow.
									<br>
									<br>
									Apart from programming, I enjoy playing video games, cross-stitching,
									 watching movies, and hanging out with my cat Dip. I find having these 
									 creative hobbies keeps my mind challenged in productive ways.
