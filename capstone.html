                                <p>
                                    For my animatronic, I wanted to lean into the DIY feel that is shown in many "maker" style YouTube videos and Mythbusters projects. Knowing that I am not an artist, I felt that this was an acheivable aesthetic to work towards. As a kid, I was always interested in how things worked and what made them "go," so by creating an animatronic at an attainable level compared to what companies such as Disney Imagineering felt like a great way to combine that childhood curiousity with my knowledge of hardware and software.

                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    I have previously taught labs involving basic Arduino Uno hardware and software, so with that background knowledge, I knew I would be able to manage all of the different types of hardware that would be necessary for this project. I have worked with LEDs, photoresistors, Servos, buttons, and speakers in the past so the biggest hardware challange I had expected was just the limit of input and output pins that are available on the Arduino Uno.
                                    After getting the code done for basic functionality for each hardware piece, I began connecting everything together and learned that Servo motors and speakers cannot both be utilizing the same Arduino. Luckily, I had a second Arduino so I was able to split the motors on one and the speaker on the other.
                                    Another issue I ran into had to do with the speaker. I bought a used computer speaker from Value Village to get parts from, but the way I had originally planned to hook it up didn't allow for enough volume. After some searching I found out that the only way to fix this issue was through the use of an amplifier. YouTube was a great resource for this with other people demonstrating how they hooked up their amplifiers. 
                                    In the end, the amplifier was all I needed to fix my volume issues.
                                    <br><br>
                                    The physical contruction of the animatronic was done as much with recycled materials as possible. Starting with a base of an iced tea powder canister was an amazing choice as it allowed for any electronics to be housed inside while still having a solid structure to add limbs and the head to. I knew I wanted to use K'Nex toys for the "bones" of the animatronic since they are strong but very light plastic. My workplace was trying to get rid of some, so I was able to get a large amount of them for free and reuse something that may otherwise be thrown out.
                                    I owned a whole bunch of patterned duct tape from when I was younger, so I used that for a lot of the construction as well as hot glue to connect everything together.
                                    The overall "skin" of the animatronic was made of felt as I had some at home from past projects, plus it is an inexpensive fabric that is available in a variety of colours.

                                <h2>Future Plans</h2>
                                <p>
                                    In the future, I want to play around with different hardware that may make the animatronic more interactive. Hooking up the ultrasonic distance sensor and creating an interaction based on that would be the first step in that plan, with that potenially activating the "greeting" interaction rather than the button. I also would like to add some different interactions such as dancing or adding something to a hand for an object retrieval task. Lastly, during my final presentation, I was given the recommendation of repositioning the photoresistor to the back of the animatronic's head to make it a bit of a hidden feature which is definitely something I am wanting to try. 

                                    For the overall contruction, creating something more permanent on the inside to hold the hardware in place would be a great addition. right now the breadboard gets strapped in and the amplifier is attached and accessible from the outside, but creating spots for the Arduinos inside would clean it up nicely. I also hope to play around with different materials for the "skin" like fleece as it is much more forgiving than felt.
                                    <br><br>
                                    This project also started a huge interest in smart home technology for me. Throughout my research I saw lots of videos where people use Arduinos or a Raspberry Pi to power their smart home so they are able to fully customize its features, and that is definitely something I am hoping to do. Since I am moving soon, the idea of automating my space to be as helpful as possible for me in my day-to-day life seems like a great next project to work on.
